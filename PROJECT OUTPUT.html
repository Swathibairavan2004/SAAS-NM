        <p style="padding-top: 10px; font-family: sans-serif;">CSK AND RR WERE BANNED DUE TO MATCH FIXING
        Cricket has a seedy underbelly that is often tainted by corruption
        Corruptors will operate across all formats and levels of the game, including Women’s cricket
        Reporting from recent events has provided further insight into cricket corruption; including the networks and corruptors involved, and the types of fixes and payments being offered
        Ensure any offers for sponsorship or to play in leagues are done through the appropriate channels

        <h3 style="height: 10px; font-size: 50px;">GENDER INQUALITY IN INDIA</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-family: sans-serif;">Gender inequality in India refers to health, education, economic and political
        Various international gender inequality indices rank India differently on each of these factors, as well as on a composite basis, and these indices are controversial
        In the context of India gender inequality is deeply rooted in societal norms, affecting opportunities, and while it impacts the lives of both the genders, statistically it is the girls that are the most disadvantaged
        The girl child tends to face extensive limitations in mobility, decision-making and access to education and health services
        Gender inequality in India is a multifaceted issue that primarily concerns women, but also affects men
        When India's population is examined as a whole, women are at a disadvantage in several important ways</p>

        <h4 style="height: 10px; font-size: 50px;">VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-family: sans-serif;">Estimates published by WHO indicate that globally about 1 in 3 (30%) of women worldwide have been subjected to either physical
        sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime
        Violence against women is a major public health problem and a violation of human rights
        For women in many parts of the world, violence is a leading cause of injury and disability, as well as a risk factor for other physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems
        Gender-based violence takes many forms: physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological
        Examples include female genital mutilation, killing in the name of so-called ‘honor’, murder, forced and early marriage, and sex trafficking
        Two of the most prevalent types of violence that women experience are intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner sexual violence (NPSV)
        Almost one in three women across the world have experienced one or both of these forms of violence at least once in their lifetime</p>

        <h5 style="height: 10px; font-size: 50px;">RAPID URBANIZATION</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-family: sans-serif;">it is the rapid migration of people from rural to urban areas,and the resulting growth of cities
        India’s urbanization is pivotal for its development, with a projection of 600 million urban dwellers by 2036
        Significant investment in infrastructure, private financing, and public services is essential
        Priorities include enhancing transportation, increasing women’s workforce participation, and addressing water security
        The World Bank supports India’s vision to create livable, inclusive cities, crucial for becoming a developed nation by 2047
        building the necessary infrastructure will be key for creating livable, climate-resilient, and inclusive cities that drive the economy forward
        Since nearly 70 % of the urban infrastructure needed by 2047 is yet to be built, sizeable investments will be required</p>
